Omoiyari is a mobile app for both Android and iOS that aims to eliminate procrastination through a process of active delaying.

To put it simply, every time you try to open an app (say, a social media app like X) the Omoiyari thinks is going to affect your productivity, at first it will prompt you to think about opening that app, so that you have some time to think about how it is going to affect your work productivity, and your general mood and happiness.
By doing so, Omoiyari will help you to lessen your screen time, save your time, and generally make you a less phone-dependent person.
It also has a built-in graphical display, so that you can view your statistics about phone-related activities.

# Inspirations
We ([@mechaman122](https://github.com/mechaman122) and [@thuankhangho](https://github.com/thuankhangho)), the creators of **Omoiyari**, would like to thank the following application for being inspirational sources to help us define and build this project:
 - [**One Sec**](https://one-sec.app/)
 - [**Blockit**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hypenet.focused&hl=en)

# Running the project
To get started with running this project, firstly install all of the necessary packages by running the following command:
```bash
npm install
```
Then, there are 3 ways to test the app (for now):

 - The web version: ```npm run web```
 - The Android version: ```npm run android```
 - The iOS version: ```npm run ios```

In the future, only one command is used to run the app:
```bash
npx expo start
```
You can check out more of Expo by looking at the [Expo's generated README file](README_expo.md) file, or check out [Expo's documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/).
